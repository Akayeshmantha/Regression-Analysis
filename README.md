## Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to

- Formulate and apply classical simple and multiple linear regression models
- Formulate and test hypotheses and use models for both prediction and explanation
- Use R to load and manipulate data, fit regression models, and generate various outputs like ANOVA tables, confidence intervals for parameters, and diagnostic assessments
- Verify/test whether or not fitted residuals conform to the assumptions that underlie classical regression
- Identify and manage outliers and influential observations
- Assess and address multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity, autocorrelation, a non-normal error term, and specification errors 
- Communicate the results of complete and well-reasoned regression analysis


## Course Overview


The focus of this course will be to provide you with the basic mathematical and computational techniques available for making informed, data-driven decisions using regression models. We will implement the models using the R programming language. We will discuss the following topics

- Distributional Theory: the Normal, t, Chi-Squared, and F distributions
- Statistical Inference: estimation, hypothesis tests, and confidence intervals
- Simple and Multiple Linear Regression
- Model Building and Variable Selection
- Outlier detection
- Model Diagnostics: outliers, multicollinearity, non-normality, autocorrelation
- Analysis of Variance
- Logistic Regression
- Penalized Regression: the Lasso and Ridge Regression
