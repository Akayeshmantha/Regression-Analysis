## Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to

- Proficiently wrangle, manipulate, and explore network data using the R programming language
- Utilize contemporary network R libraries including *statnet* and *igraph*
- Visualize network data
- Partition networks using contemporary community detection methods
- Formulate data-driven hypotheses about relational systems using network analysis tools

## Course Overview


The focus of this course will be to provide you with the basic mathematical and computational techniques available for making informed, data-driven decisions using regression models. We will implement the models using the R programming language. We will discuss the following topics

- Distributional Theory: the Normal, t, Chi-Squared, and F distributions
- Simple and Multiple Linear Regression
- Model Building and Variable Selection
- Outlier detection
- Model Diagnostics:
