## Textbooks

- *Applied Linear Regression Models- 4th Edition* by Kutner, Nachtsheim, and Neter (Required)
- *Introduction to Statistical Learning* ([online](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20First%20Printing.pdf))

## Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to

- Formulate and apply classical simple and multiple linear regression models
- Formulate and test hypotheses and use models for both prediction and explanation
- Use R to load and manipulate data, fit regression models, and generate various outputs like ANOVA tables, confidence intervals for parameters, and diagnostic assessments
- Verify/test whether or not fitted residuals conform to the assumptions that underlie classical regression
- Identify and manage outliers and influential observations
- Assess and address multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity, autocorrelation, non-normality, model misspecification
- Communicate the results of complete and well-reasoned regression analysis


## Course Overview


The focus of this course will be to provide you with the basic mathematical and computational techniques available for making informed, data-driven decisions using regression models. We will implement the models using the R programming language. We will discuss the following topics

- Distributional Theory: the Normal, t, Chi-Squared, and F distributions
- Statistical Inference: estimation, hypothesis tests, and confidence intervals
- Simple and Multiple Linear Regression
- Model Building and Variable Selection
- Outlier detection
- Model Diagnostics: outliers, multicollinearity, non-normality, autocorrelation
- Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
- Logistic Regression
- Shrinkage Methods: the Lasso and Ridge Regression


### Assessment

The focus of this course will be to provide you with the basic techniques available for making informed, data-driven decisions using the R programming language. This is *not* a statistics course, but will provide you the intuition to make hypotheses about complex questions through visualization, wrangling, manipulation, and exploration of data. The course will be graded based on the following components:

- **Assignments** (30%): You will be assigned computational and theoretical homework assignments to be completed and turned in on Canvas
- **Quizzes** (20%): Each week you will be given a short quiz that tests the main lessons taught in class from the previous week. These are given on **Mondays at 9:00 AM**
- **Final Exam** (20%): The final exam will be a comprehensive exam covering the main components of Regression analysis
- **Final Project** (30%): The final project will be a computational case study that brings together the techniques learned throughout the semester. The description for this project will be provided towards the mid point of the semester.
